# THIS IS AN ARCHIVAL REPOSITORY

_Update 24.2_: Original repository with its intact issue tracker is now available on [https://github.com/tonitaip-2020/postgresql-for-novices](https://github.com/tonitaip-2020/postgresql-for-novices)

No PostgreSQL for novices is being done here. Since original repository is for the moment in some sort of limbo, this acts as a reference for job seeking.

PostgreSQL for novices is available on PyPI. `pip install pg4n` PyPI version is slightly newer than this repository due to a single team member putting in late hours to get course mark.

`PostgreSQL for novices` is a wrapper program for `psql` written in Python that uses `pexpect` to intercept & inject terminal data, `psycopg` for fetching database diagnostics, `pyparsing` for parsing terminal data, and a bunch of other libraries.

## Notes for developers

### Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging. Although one should refer to [Poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for a thorough introduction, here's a short summary of the intended workflow with Poetry:

- To install all dependencies and the application, type `poetry install`. After installation, if the Python scripts folder is in your PATH, you should be able to invoke `main.main()` with `pg4n`.
- To make VS Code use Poetry's virtual environment, type `poetry env info`, copy virtual environment executable path, press F1 and type `Python: Select Interpreter` > `Enter interpreter path...` > paste path and press `<ENTER>`.
- To add/remove a dependency, type `poetry add <dep>`/`poetry remove <dep>`.
- To execute a command from within virtual environment shell, type `poetry run <cmd>`.
- To enter a shell session within the Poetry virtual environment, type `poetry shell`.

#### Versioning

You can bump the version number automatically with `poetry version patch`, `poetry version minor`, etc. See `poetry version -h`.

See version history [here](https://pypi.org/project/pg4n/#history).

### Imports

During development, you must run the program as a module, e.g., `poetry run python -m src.pg4n.main`, so that the imports work.

### Running tests

Having PostgreSQL running on port 5432, do `poetry run pytest`.

You may need to provide environment variables that match your config:

| Variable     | Default value   | Description                                             |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PGHOST`     | `127.0.0.1`     | Hostname of the PostgreSQL server.                      |
| `PGPORT`     | `5432`          | Port to an active PostgreSQL instance.                  |
| `PGUSER`     | `postgres`      | The user that will be used to manage the test database. |
| `PGPASSWORD` |                 | Password, in case password authentication is used.      |
| `PGDBNAME`   | `test_database` | Database name.                                          |
 
For example, if PostgreSQL is on port 5433, just do `PGPORT=5433 poetry run pytest` (Bash syntax).

#### Using docker

To get a similar PostgreSQL instance as with GitHub Actions workflow:<br>
`docker run --rm -P -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres:14.5-alpine`

You'll need to tell pytest the password: `PGPASSWORD=postgres poetry run pytest`.

### Building documents

1. If `docs/api` is not up-to-date or doesn't exist, run:<br>`poetry run sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/api src/pg4n '*/test*'`
2. To generate the documentation:<br>`poetry run sphinx-build -b html docs docs/build`

Note that the GitHub Pages site is only updated on pushes to `main` branch.

### Linting

For linting, you need the CI tools: `poetry install --with=ci`. The tools used are:
- `black` for formatting
- `pylint` for linting
- `mypy` for static type checking
- `isort` for sorting imports

To get a grade that the CI/CD pipeline would give you, you can do `poetry run scripts/ci-grade.sh` to run all the checks. The output is possibly long, so pipe it to a file perusal filter such as `less` to scroll through it and search for things of concern, e.g., `summary` to see scores.
